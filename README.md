Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to develop an application for accurately extracting electricity meter readings and meter numbers from images. This application involves several stages, including preprocessing images to enhance readability, employing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to extract relevant data, and presenting this information in an accessible and user-friendly format. The scope of the project includes selecting the most effective preprocessing techniques, comparing various OCR models and APIs, and implementing robust error handling mechanisms to ensure reliable performance.
Objectives:
The objective of this project is to develop an application for accurately extracting electricity meter readings and meter numbers from images. This involves several key goals:
1.	Accurate Data Extraction: Ensure the precise extraction of both meter readings and meter numbers from images, leveraging advanced OCR techniques and effective preprocessing methods to handle a variety of image qualities and conditions.
2.	User-Friendly Presentation: Design a user-friendly interface to present the extracted information in an accessible format, facilitating easy interpretation and use of the data by end-users.
Approach
Image Preprocessing
1.	Noise Reduction:
o	Techniques Considered:
	Gaussian Smoothing: This technique reduces noise by averaging the pixels with a Gaussian kernel.
	Median Filtering: This non-linear method replaces each pixel with the median of the surrounding pixels, effectively removing noise while preserving edges.
	Wavelet Denoising: This method uses wavelet transforms to separate noise from the signal and is particularly effective for preserving important image details.
o	Chosen Technique: Wavelet Denoising
o	Reason for Choice: Wavelet denoising was selected due to its superior ability to reduce noise while preserving critical features of the image. This balance is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the meter readings during the OCR process.
2.	Colour Contrast Enhancement:
o	Techniques Considered:
	Histogram Equalization: This method enhances contrast by spreading out the most frequent intensity values.
	Adaptive Histogram Equalization: An improved version of histogram equalization that works on small regions of the image, enhancing local contrast and providing better results in images with varying lighting conditions.
	Contrast Stretching: This technique enhances the contrast by stretching the range of intensity values.
o	Chosen Technique: Adaptive Histogram Equalization
o	Reason for Choice: Adaptive histogram equalization was chosen because it provides more accurate results in images with varying lighting, especially in darker areas. This accuracy is essential for ensuring the OCR process can read the meter values correctly.
3.	Image Orientation Adjustment:
o	Technique: Data Augmentation by Rotating Images
o	Reason for Choice: Ensuring that the application can handle various image orientations is crucial. By augmenting the training data with rotated images, the model learns to recognize meter readings from different angles, improving the robustness and accuracy of the OCR process.
